description: Dispatch and orchestrate local Cursor Composer 2.5 subagents via the standalone cursor-agent CLI for ferrum-nexus issue/PR work — implementer, fix-round, and shepherd modes, with worktree isolation and the review loop. Composer is the fast tier of the agent fleet. Use when the user asks Claude to spawn Composer/Cursor Composer agents on issues, PRs, review findings, or red CI.

# composer-agents: Cursor Composer 2.5 subagent orchestration

You are the ORCHESTRATOR. Composer agents implement/fix; you verify their diffs, drive merge
decisions, and never let an unreviewed PR merge. This skill drives the operator's own standalone
`cursor-agent` CLI in print mode — the same launcher shape as `grok-agents` — pinned to
`composer-2.5` by default, with an optional Fast SKU. It never uses Conductor's bundled Cursor
harness, whose copies lag the standalone releases.

**Guard: do NOT use this skill when you are yourself a dispatched worker.** If your session prompt
references `agent-brief.md` / `continuation-brief.md`, says "YOU are the implementer", or hands
you an existing worktree and findings to fix, implement directly. Do not recursively dispatch
another worker.

## Remote CI validation

Do not run local builds, tests, benchmarks, or compilation-based checks, including `npm run build`,
`npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and their workspace-scoped forms, or wrappers that
invoke them. Do not make an exception for a targeted check, an ambiguous failure, or a controller's
routine validation request. Local source inspection, formatting with `npx prettier --write`, and
`git diff --check` are allowed.

Use remote CI results for the exact pushed head SHA as build/test confirmation. Inspect failed
job logs, fix the demonstrated failure, push the change, and use the next CI run to confirm it.
Pending, skipped, unavailable, or earlier-head checks are not evidence that the change passed.
Keep adding or updating relevant tests; remote CI executes them.

The controller owns post-push CI monitoring unless the worker is explicitly assigned a CI repair
or shepherd round. A worker assigned to exit after pushing must report the head SHA and CI status
as pending or unverified and exit; the controller continues the CI-driven fix loop. Never report
build/test success without matching remote evidence.

Include the no-local-build/test rule and remote CI confirmation requirement in every dispatch
prompt, including continuation prompts and any permitted nested delegation.

## Dispatch command (exact shape)

Resolve the absolute path to this repository's `.agents/skills/composer-agents` directory, write a
prompt file outside the repo, then launch:

```bash
<ABS_REPO>/.agents/skills/composer-agents/scripts/dispatch-agent.sh \
  --worktree <ABS_PATH_TO_WORKER_WORKTREE> \
  --prompt-file <ABS_PROMPT_FILE>
```

`--effort low|medium|high|xhigh|max` is accepted for CLI parity with sibling skills but is ignored —
Composer 2.5 publishes no reasoning tiers. Do not claim an effort level was applied.

Append `--fast` only when the user explicitly requests fast mode for that dispatch or fleet. Never
infer it from urgency, deadlines, task size, the fleet's "fast tier" label, or available credits.
Omit it otherwise; without the flag the launcher pins standard mode.

Non-negotiables:
- The launcher pins **`composer-2.5`** normally and selects **`composer-2.5-fast`** only with the
  explicitly authorized `--fast` flag. Fast runs consume fast credits.
- The `cursor-agent` binary is resolved from `CURSOR_AGENT_BIN`, then `~/.local/bin/cursor-agent`
  / `/opt/homebrew/bin/cursor-agent` / `/usr/local/bin/cursor-agent`, then `PATH`. Any candidate
  under `com.conductor.app` is refused — Conductor's bundle lags the standalone release.
- Auth is either an exported `CURSOR_API_KEY` (inherited by `cursor-agent`, never placed on argv
  where `ps` would expose it) or the CLI's own stored login (`cursor-agent status`). Never print
  the key or put it in prompts, files, arguments, or logs, and do not ask the worker to log in
  interactively.
- Run each dispatch as a **background / long-lived task**; prefer one task per agent.
- **Parallel cap: 7** unless the user sets a lower limit.

## Prompt construction (all modes)

Every prompt starts with:
`First read <ABS_REPO>/.agents/skills/composer-agents/references/agent-brief.md and follow it exactly`
(implementer) or
`Read <ABS_REPO>/.agents/skills/composer-agents/references/continuation-brief.md AND
<ABS_REPO>/.agents/skills/composer-agents/references/agent-brief.md and follow them`
(fix/shepherd — give BOTH absolute paths).

Use only those `.agents/skills/composer-agents/references/` paths so Claude and Codex/GPT
orchestrators share one source of truth.

Every prompt must also PIN THE WORKER'S ROLE:
"YOU are the implementer: write, commit, and push the changes yourself in this session.
Do NOT invoke agent-dispatch skills (composer-agents, grok-agents, astra-agents, opus-agents,
fable-agents, .agents/skills/*/scripts/dispatch-agent.sh) and do NOT spawn nested workers."

Then append the mode block:

**Implementer (fresh issue):** issue number, worktree dir `issue-<N>` under a sibling
`<repo>-agents/` dir, branch name, acceptance criteria, repo-invariant callouts, scope boundaries
vs neighboring in-flight PRs.

**Fix round (existing PR):** PR number, existing worktree path, current head SHA, verified
findings verbatim, CI-red diagnosis, per-finding guidance (fix vs acceptable-rebuttal).

**Shepherd (drive to clean+green):** like fix round, plus loop until review-clean AND CI green.
Only when the user wants agents babysitting CI.

**Cadence override (recommended default — CI takes 20-30 min):** append:
"CADENCE OVERRIDE: do NOT wait for in-progress CI. Loop: reconstruct state -> fix findings + RED
checks -> fmt -> push -> ONE review trigger -> EXIT with report."

## Orchestrator duties between agent rounds

1. On each agent completion: verify from GitHub (never the agent's claims alone) — head pushed?
   trigger posted to the correct bot? threads replied?
2. Independently review the diff in the agent's worktree before any merge
   (`git fetch origin main && git diff origin/main...HEAD` — three-dot).
3. Triage CI reds yourself when agents are gone.
4. Salvage protocol for dead agents: check worktree status + unpushed commits, then relaunch a
   continuation agent with a state snapshot.
5. Merge only when: review bot clean on the CURRENT head + CI green + your own review done.

## Known failure modes

- `cursor-agent` unresolvable, or refused because the only candidate is under `com.conductor.app` —
  stop and report; install the standalone CLI or set `CURSOR_AGENT_BIN`. Do not fall back to
  Conductor's bundle.
- Neither `CURSOR_API_KEY` nor a stored `cursor-agent` login available — stop and report; do not
  attempt an interactive login or fall back to another model.
- Capacity or transport kills mid-loop — work may already be pushed; check PR state first.
- Agents may exit claiming "waiting on monitor" — treat every completion as end-of-turn.
- Nested dispatch: if a completed run's report mentions "dispatching a worker", treat the actual
  implementing model as unknown and weight your independent diff review accordingly.
